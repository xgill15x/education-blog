              An Snapshot Introduction to Social Reproduction in Education üì∏
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              As a teacher, Social Reproduction Theory (SRT) is a concept you
              must familiarize yourself with to better hone your craft. It seeks
              to explain how educational systems have the unique ability to
              reinforce social norms, values and inequalities. You, as a
              teacher, have more power than you may know. This power is immense
              and comes with great responsibility (a cliche, I know üò¨). The
              ideas from SRT should serve as a reminder regarding a couple of
              things. First, each step in the pedagogy process matters, as it
              will shape the future generation and what they deem important.
              Second, you have the opportunity to make your classroom a space
              where societal norms are not only questioned but reimagined.
              Encouraging your students to connect the themes taught in class to
              real-world issues, without prejudice, allows them to make changes
              beyond the four walls of your classroom.
              <br />
              <br />
              To provide the bigger picture around SRT, it's a framework to
              analyze how societal structures, dominant norms and power
              relations within society are reproduced throughout generations,
              relying on institutions, such as schools, families and workplaces.
              It illustrates how education perpetuates inequality within the
              classes, races, and genders as it lays out the "who should get
              what" narrative prevalent in the world. For example, it can help
              us explore if the current education structure naturally tends to
              students primed for workforce positions, with the goal being to
              disrupt patterns showing bias towards current societal
              expectations which ultimately keep existing structures intact.
              Discussions of this nature allow everyone an equal opportunity to
              think critically and change the dominant ideologies.

              An absolutely beautiful and creative piece to introduce you to
              Social Reproduction Theory is a song by Harry Chaplin called
              "Flowers Are Red". It's a rather poignant story of a child who
              loses his creative spark as a result of the oppressive pedagogy
              practiced by his teacher. It's an homage to the importance of
              encouraging individuality and questioning norms not only in
              education but also in society.

              This video captures the critical aspects of Social Reproduction
              Theory as well as anything else could in a span of 5 minutes. His
              first teacher's insistence on standardizing the world, down to how
              the student depicted flowers, is an all too common reflection of
              society's tendency towards uniformity rather than individuality.
              Through the lens of SRT, one must wonder how standardized
              expectations will impact future generations and to what extent
              homogenized thought stops benefiting society. As we continue
              watching, the child is under the supervision of a new teacher who
              encourages originality and unique expression of thought. It's a
              pivotal moment in the story that allows the child a chance to
              rekindle his optimism (though sadly we don't know if he ever does
              üòû). The new teacher represents the cathartic potential of
              education. This figure represents the idea that teachers can help
              students challenge norms and envision a world beyond the one they
              are often expected to blindly inherit. This video invites
              pedagogical figures to question:{" "}

              A Personal Anecdote üìù
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Having recently finished my last internship, I noticed quite an
              overlap between my academic and corporate experiences. Both of
              these worlds measured my performance, either with a standardized
              letter grade system or a rubric-like performance scale. Similarly,
              just as I was required to present my work at school via academic
              presentations, I demoed my work in front of my team for new
              features I had implemented. While I can recognize the value these
              ventures brought to my personal and career growth, I can't help
              but reflect on the factors that more than likely have had a hand
              in influencing my direction in life. Have I succeeded because of
              my individuality and passion for what I love, or has the education
              system, with all its quirks and motives laid out by Social
              Reproduction Theory, prepared me to be the perfect worker for
              capitalist interests? This possibility is entertained by Backer
              and Cairns as they discuss how ‚Äúthe [current] education system is
              required to produce individuals who are selected and arranged in a
              hierarchy such that [the goal of] giving everyone equal education
              opportunity cannot overcome the real inequalities‚Äù (Backer &
              Cairns, 2021).

              The fact of the matter is that educational institutions have the
              distinctive ability to groom individuals for specific societal
              roles in order to align with the current needs of Western
              capitalism, and this process no doubt requires meticulous moulding
              of its subjects and promoting conformity and productivity,
              regardless of whether it fuels vicious cycles of inequality. The
              parallels between my academic and corporate environments are too
              apparent to chalk up as coincidence. It's a blatant display of how
              behaviours rewarded in an educational environment conveniently
              align with behaviours expected in the corporate world. This was
              all the more clear to me after studying Social Reproduction Theory
              and why I believe educators must be aware of this framework too.
