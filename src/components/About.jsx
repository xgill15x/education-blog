      bio: "Hey, I'm Jason. I've attended both private and public schools in Canada and experienced how cultural and religious influences play a part in modern education. These experiences have allowed me to garner a breadth of perspectives on the art of pedagogy. While my education has been rooted in Canadian education, I collaborate closely with Hoang to pair my insights with his international perspective. Having recently been enlightened by the ideas presented in SFU's 'Social Issues in Education' class, I aim to provide educators with the intellectual sustenance that I believe will help them create a positive impact for all students.",

      bio: "Hi, I'm Hoang. As an international student, I have had the opportunity to study in two completely different educational settings, in two different cultures, each with its own approach to pedagogy. Having experienced both settings, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how the relationship between teachers and students can shape the learning experience. My story and advice come from this unique perspective, where I now vouch for the importance of creating an environment that values student voice. By sharing my insights, I hope to help educators reflect on how we can improve the educational experience for future generations.",
